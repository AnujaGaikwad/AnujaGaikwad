# About Me  

</div>

I am a final-year engineering student with a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.  
I learn AI concepts through hands-on Python projects, focusing on practical implementation rather than theory alone.  
I enjoy understanding how algorithms work, building automation systems, and applying AI to real-world problems.  
I excel in problem-solving and logical thinking, with a strong habit of self-learning and a consistent drive for growth.
